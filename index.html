<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Our full-grain leather wallets are built with the best leather we can get our hands-on. Let me explain. Leather has grain, which is the tough fibers at the top part of the hide. Most factories buy flawless leather that doesn't have any more scars or marks after they shaved them all off. Now they don't have to throw away nearly as much leather as we do because they don't have to cut around scars. But in doing this, they also shaved off the toughest fibers of the leather.</p>
<p>The full-grain leather gets a nice rich patina and is super water-resistant. It's called Top Grain Leather when they remove some of the grain, it's called top grain leather. Genuine leather is when they remove all of the grain. It's why our full-grain leather wallets are so expensive.</p>
